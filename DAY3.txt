主題title:在Siri的演講語言辨識中找到特定目標

內容contents:ASR accuracy has been improved recent years.
There ara some bottleneck like small local businesses,entitles.
Introduce Geo-LMs(geolocation-based language models)
ASR systems comprise two major components:acoustic & language model
簡單來說就是加入了geo的前處理
Siri A hybrid convolutional neural network CNN-HMM [6] is used in all experiments.
The AM was trained with filter bank features from about 5,000 hours of English speech data.
ASR 
Flexible training
Efficient LM construction at runtime
Significant ASR accuracy improvement over the general LM at the task of local POI recognitionsystem uses a weighted finite state transducer (WFST)-based decoder,
